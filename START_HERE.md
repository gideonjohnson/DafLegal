Don't rush - follow the guides carefully. Each step builds on the previous one.

### 2. Test Everything
After each setup, test the feature. Don't wait until the end.

### 3. Use Test Mode First
Use Stripe test mode, Google OAuth testing mode, etc. before going live.

Store all API keys and secrets in Render environment variables, never in code.

### 5. Monitor Logs
Check Render logs regularly for errors. Catch issues early.

### 6. Start with Free Tiers
All services have generous free tiers. Upgrade only when needed.
