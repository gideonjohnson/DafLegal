# How to Choose the Right Legal Tech Platform for Your Firm

The legal tech market is crowded with solutions promising to revolutionize your practice. Some deliver on that promise. Many don't. Here's how to separate the winners from the hype and choose technology that actually works for your firm.

## Start With the Problem, Not the Solution

**Common Mistake:** Buying technology because it's innovative or because competitors have it.

**Better Approach:** Clearly define the problem you're solving.

### Ask Yourself:
- What specific pain point are we addressing?
- How much time/money is this problem costing us?
- What would success look like?
- Who is most affected by this problem?

**Example:** "Our contract review process takes too long" is vague. "Partner time on routine NDA reviews costs $75K annually with 3-day turnaround frustrating clients" is specific and measurable.

## The 5 Critical Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Ease of Use

**Why It Matters:** The best technology is the technology people actually use. If it requires extensive training or feels clunky, adoption will fail.

**What to Look For:**
- Can non-technical users navigate it easily?
- Is the interface intuitive?
- How long does onboarding take?
- Is training included?

**Red Flags:**
- Requires IT expertise to operate
- Steep learning curve
- Poor user interface design
- Minimal documentation

**Test It:** Most platforms offer free trials. Have your actual users (not just tech-savvy partners) test it with real work.

### 2. Integration Capabilities

**Why It Matters:** Technology that doesn't integrate with your existing systems creates more work, not less.

**What to Look For:**
- Does it work with your document management system?
- Can it integrate with your billing platform?
- Does it support your file formats?
- Are there APIs for custom integrations?

**Questions to Ask Vendors:**
- What integrations are pre-built?
- How difficult are custom integrations?
- What's the data import/export process?

### 3. Security & Compliance

**Why It Matters:** You're dealing with confidential client information. A data breach could destroy your firm.

**Must-Haves:**
- Bank-level encryption (AES-256)
- SOC 2 Type II certification
- GDPR compliance (if applicable)
- Attorney-client privilege protections
- Data sovereignty controls

**Questions to Ask:**
- Where is data stored physically?
- Who can access our data?
- What happens to data if we cancel?
- How do you handle data breaches?
- Can we audit your security practices?

**Red Flag:** Vague answers about security or reluctance to provide documentation.

### 4. Cost vs. Value

**Why It Matters:** The cheapest solution often ends up being the most expensive when you factor in lost productivity and switching costs.

**Total Cost of Ownership Includes:**
- License fees (per user? per matter?)
- Implementation costs
- Training expenses
- Integration costs
- Ongoing support fees
- Hidden fees (storage, API calls, etc.)

**Calculate ROI:**
```
Annual Time Saved × Hourly Rate = Annual Value
Annual Value - Total Cost = Net Benefit

Example:
5 hours/week saved × $300/hour × 50 weeks = $75,000 value
Platform cost: $12,000/year
Net benefit: $63,000/year
```

**Pro Tip:** Ask vendors for references from firms similar to yours. Talk to them about hidden costs and actual ROI.

### 5. Vendor Viability & Support

**Why It Matters:** You're not just buying software - you're entering a long-term relationship. If the vendor fails or support is poor, you're stuck.

**Evaluate the Vendor:**
- How long have they been in business?
- Who are their investors?
- What's their customer retention rate?
- How often do they release updates?

**Support Matters:**
- What channels are available? (phone, email, chat)
- What are support hours?
- What's the response time SLA?
- Is there a dedicated account manager?
- Is there a user community?

**Red Flags:**
- Very young company with limited funding
- Poor online reviews about support
- Unclear update/roadmap schedule
- Email-only support

## The Evaluation Process

### Phase 1: Research & Shortlist (1-2 weeks)

1. Define your requirements clearly
2. Research potential solutions
3. Read reviews from actual users (not just vendor marketing)
4. Create a shortlist of 3-5 candidates

### Phase 2: Deep Dive (2-3 weeks)

1. Schedule demos with each vendor
2. Request free trials
3. Test with real work, not toy examples
4. Talk to reference customers
5. Review security documentation
6. Calculate detailed ROI

### Phase 3: Decision (1 week)

1. Create a scoring matrix based on your criteria
2. Involve stakeholders who will actually use it
3. Review contract terms carefully
4. Negotiate pricing and terms
5. Plan implementation timeline

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall #1: Buying Based on Features Alone

**The Problem:** A long feature list doesn't matter if you won't use most features or if the core functionality is weak.

**Better Approach:** Focus on how well it solves your specific problem.

### Pitfall #2: Ignoring Change Management

**The Problem:** Technology fails when people don't adopt it, and adoption requires change management.

**Better Approach:** Plan for:
- Training sessions
- Champions within the firm
- Gradual rollout
- Ongoing support
- Addressing resistance

### Pitfall #3: Not Negotiating Terms

**The Problem:** Accepting the vendor's first offer often means overpaying and accepting unfavorable terms.

**Better Approach:** Everything is negotiable:
- Pricing (especially multi-year contracts)
- Payment terms
- Termination clauses
- Data ownership
- Support SLAs

### Pitfall #4: Skipping the Trial Period

**The Problem:** Demos are marketing. Real usage reveals problems.

**Better Approach:** Always use the free trial period with actual work. Many issues only become apparent during real use.

## Special Considerations for Contract Analysis Tools

Since contract analysis is one of the fastest-growing legal tech categories, here are specific criteria:

### Accuracy
- What's the precision rate for clause extraction?
- How does it handle unusual contract structures?
- Can it learn your firm's preferences?

### Customization
- Can you create custom clause libraries?
- Can you set firm-specific risk criteria?
- Can you add your own templates?

### Output Quality
- How are results presented?
- Can you export to your preferred format?
- Does it integrate with your document comparison tools?

### Training Data
- Is it trained on actual legal contracts?
- Does it understand legal nuance?
- Can it handle industry-specific terminology?

## Your Action Plan

1. **This Week:** Define your specific problem and success criteria
2. **Next Week:** Research solutions and create shortlist
3. **Weeks 3-4:** Test top 3 solutions with real work
4. **Week 5:** Make decision and negotiate contract
5. **Week 6+:** Implementation and rollout

## The Bottom Line

Choosing legal technology is like choosing a partner - it's a significant commitment that will impact your practice for years. Don't rush it. Don't buy based on hype.

Use this framework to evaluate objectively. Test thoroughly. And choose the solution that actually solves your problem, not the one with the best marketing.
