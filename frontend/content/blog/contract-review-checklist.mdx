# The Essential Contract Review Checklist: What Every Lawyer Should Look For

Contract review is both an art and a science. Miss a critical clause, and your client could face significant liability. But spend too long on every detail, and you'll price yourself out of the market. This checklist helps you strike the right balance.

## Before You Start: Context Matters

Don't dive into the contract blind. First, understand:

- **Who are the parties?** Their relative bargaining power matters
- **What's the business goal?** Every contract serves a purpose
- **What are the key risks?** Industry-specific concerns
- **What's negotiable?** Some terms are deal-breakers, others are nice-to-haves

## Section 1: The Parties & Effective Date

### Verify Party Information

✅ **Correct legal names** - Not trade names or DBAs
✅ **Proper entity types** - LLC, Corp, Partnership, etc.
✅ **Jurisdiction of formation** - Which state/country
✅ **Authority to sign** - Do signatories have proper authorization

### Check the Dates

✅ **Effective date** is clearly stated
✅ **Term length** is appropriate
✅ **Renewal provisions** are understood
✅ **Termination dates** align with business needs

## Section 2: Scope of Work & Deliverables

This is where many disputes originate. Be specific:

✅ **Detailed description** of goods/services
✅ **Performance standards** and quality metrics
✅ **Acceptance criteria** clearly defined
✅ **Delivery schedules** and milestones
✅ **Change order process** for modifications

**Red Flag:** Vague language like "best efforts" or "reasonable quality" invites disputes.

## Section 3: Payment Terms

Money matters require precision:

✅ **Total compensation** amount
✅ **Payment schedule** and milestones
✅ **Invoice procedures** and timelines
✅ **Late payment penalties** (if applicable)
✅ **Expense reimbursement** terms
✅ **Tax treatment** clarification

**Pro Tip:** Ensure payment terms align with deliverable milestones to protect both parties.

## Section 4: Warranties & Representations

These are promises the parties make to each other:

✅ **Authority to enter** the agreement
✅ **No conflicting obligations** exist
✅ **Compliance with laws** confirmed
✅ **Product/service warranties** are appropriate
✅ **Disclaimer of implied warranties** (if applicable)

**Negotiation Point:** Warranties should be mutual and balanced unless there's good reason otherwise.

## Section 5: Intellectual Property Rights

Critical for protecting your client's innovations:

✅ **Ownership of deliverables** is clear
✅ **License grants** are properly scoped
✅ **Restrictions on use** are enforceable
✅ **Background IP** is protected
✅ **Assignment provisions** for created works

**Common Mistake:** Assuming work product automatically belongs to the client - it doesn't without explicit assignment language.

## Section 6: Confidentiality & Data Protection

In our digital age, data protection is paramount:

✅ **Definition of confidential information** is comprehensive
✅ **Permitted uses** are limited and specific
✅ **Disclosure restrictions** include employees and contractors
✅ **Return/destruction** obligations upon termination
✅ **GDPR/privacy law compliance** (if applicable)

## Section 7: Liability & Indemnification

This is where you protect your client from catastrophic risk:

✅ **Limitation of liability** caps exposure
✅ **Indemnification** provisions are mutual (if appropriate)
✅ **Insurance requirements** are adequate
✅ **Exclusions** for consequential damages
✅ **Scope of indemnity** is clearly defined

**Critical:** Unlimited liability can destroy a business. Always negotiate caps except for intentional misconduct.

## Section 8: Termination & Dispute Resolution

How the relationship can end matters as much as how it begins:

✅ **Termination for convenience** (if desired)
✅ **Termination for cause** with cure periods
✅ **Post-termination obligations** are specified
✅ **Dispute resolution method** (arbitration vs. litigation)
✅ **Governing law** and venue are favorable

## Section 9: Boilerplate Provisions

Don't skip these - they matter more than you think:

✅ **Entire agreement** clause
✅ **Amendment procedures** require writing
✅ **Assignment restrictions** protect relationship
✅ **Severability** preserves agreement if one provision fails
✅ **Force majeure** covers unforeseen circumstances
✅ **Notices** provision specifies how to communicate

## Section 10: Industry-Specific Provisions

Depending on the contract type, also verify:

### For Service Agreements
- Performance metrics and SLAs
- Subcontractor permissions
- Key personnel requirements

### For Sales Contracts
- Risk of loss transfer point
- Shipping and delivery terms
- Return and warranty procedures

### For Employment Contracts
- Non-compete reasonableness
- Benefits and compensation
- Termination procedures

## Using Technology to Streamline Review

Modern AI tools can help you review contracts faster without sacrificing quality:

- **Automated clause extraction** finds key provisions instantly
- **Risk flagging** highlights unusual or problematic terms
- **Compliance checking** against your playbook
- **Comparison to standards** shows deviations from your templates

**Reality Check:** A thorough manual review of a complex contract takes 2-4 hours. AI-assisted review cuts this to 30-45 minutes while improving consistency.
